1) Developed a method for Image segmentation to generate Individual alphabets from an image of handwritten words using Neural 
Network & Skeletonization.
2) Generated artificial data to produce the positive & negative examples for the segmentation task by adding some distortion 
to the training dataset & used it for training the Neural network.
3) Trained the IAM dataset for the individual alphabet classification & recognition in Scanned documents using Convolutional 
Neural Network (CNN).
4) Tools Used: Python, Tensorflow, OpenCV.
